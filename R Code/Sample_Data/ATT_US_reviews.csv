When I wanted to deactivate it a few months later, I found out that I would have to pay a huge breakup fee for a device that was never supposed to be in a contract (that is the main reason people buy unlocked devices - so they dont get stuck with a contract).  I went back to this place twice in person, and 1.5 weeks later they still had not rectified the situation even though I visited the store twice, and when I called them after the 1.5 weeks they kept giving me the run around.

When I was charged for the old phone not being returned to AT and T, I called customer service and referred back to the store. I proceeded to call the store five separate times and reached five separate employees, all of whom were different and claimed that they had no idea what I was talking about (for reference, this store is tiny). Each promised to call me back within 24 hours with a resolution to the issue; none did.Finally I reached the manager, who told me that they had lost several old phones meant to be sent back to AT and T. He promised me a resolution in 24 hours. After that time elapsed, he promised it within 48 hours. No resolution, no callback. Finally AT and T called me demanding the payment and after an hour on the phone with them they resolved it.This is a cliche ""I never write reviews but I had to this time"" deal: This store is awful, the employees are incompetent, inefficient and rude on the phone.

He patiently helped my mother understand how to make me an authorized account holder over the phone and then walked me through the process of getting my phone. As a sales person, there's a real value in someone who understands how to explain transparently WHY things work the way they do, while also giving you clarity on the value of every option. He really brought me up to speed with how the billing works for new phones now (something that changed between the time I last bought my phone). While I am looking at years of paying off my new phone as opposed to the old experience of getting a new phone for less every few years, I feel like he educated me on every step of the process and helped me set myself up for the next time I need to upgrade so this doesn't happen again.  Baraki even put on my new screen protector and found the perfect case for my needs. Legitimately Apple has incredible customer service, but when it came to getting my new phone, I'm super happy I ended up going into the store today because it's been a really long time since I looked at exactly what our family is being charged and why when it comes to our phone service.

I was immediately greeted before the door closed behind me. The sales associate Jonathan was freaking awesome. Being from a sales background I am pretty cautious and am very aware of up selling . Not only was he extremely curtious, he also saved me some money on my bill while upping my gigs. Nor did he try to sell me anything I didn't need!

211,AT&T Authorized Retailer,60661,"20 S Clinton St, Chicago, IL 60661, USA",I went to this store on 22 June at 6 PM . It took them 2 hrs to activate my sim . A lady at front desk is continuously  talking to someone .representatives were not at all responsible for the customers who step in . This is my second worst experience at this store with the same lady . I would suggest the store manager to look into this . It takes 2 min activate a sim .and the lady suggested me to call att customer care . I don't understand why do I have to call customer care when I am at this store . After all the waiting time for 2 hrs I went into att store on Adams street which took 2 mins for them to activate my sim . Worst ever service .,6/24/16 14:31,1,-1
